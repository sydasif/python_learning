# Python

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

* **Python is Interpreted** Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it.

* **Python is Interactive** You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

* **Python is Object-Oriented** Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

* **Python is a Beginner's Language** Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to Network Automation.
